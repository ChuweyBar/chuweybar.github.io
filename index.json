Thus when I finally remembered to share an image with my friends, I always struggle to find the image I had in my head.\nIf there is a way for me to use an algorithm to figure out what\u0026rsquo;s in each image I download, I can create a database where I can then associate the text within the image with the image itself, thus making lookup a breeze.\nExperiments #The easiest option to look up an image I have in my head is using texts in these images.\nA short search online indicates the problem of \u0026ldquo;identify text in image\u0026rdquo; is called Optical Character Recognition(OCR) and it has already been solved. I narrowed down two options:\nEasyOCR: One of the easiest to implement traditional method I can run locally. Google Cloud Vision API: Google\u0026rsquo;s production level OCR that is free as long as I make less than 1000 calls a month. Experiementation With Both OCR Tools #Selecting a random image with hand written characters, I got the following results:\n@s\u0026#34; lekJIilkec Civlicws call Load plaqve roonds AUNNYC@ Mose Good Hne From this image: Using the same image with Google\u0026rsquo;s Vision API I got:\nBut sir! those look like Civilians Good call Load the plague rounds ifunny.co It seems for a small project Google\u0026rsquo;s Cloud Vision API is the best way forward.\nDatabase On Github Pages #Now I need a database to be hosted online for me to do the lookup. With this page being hosted on github, it means the database must be static. Since the backend of the page is a github repository, everytime I modify the database I would need to push to it.\nGiven I\u0026rsquo;ve not touched databases that much in the past, SQLite seems the perfect place to get started.\nPlan #Thus far, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty clear that I want to:\nCreate a static database with SQLite. Fill the database with a script that called Google\u0026rsquo;s cloud vision API to associate text with image. Look up entries from said database on this website.

But that\u0026rsquo;s for next time.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/projects/memedb/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Static Database On Github Pages"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/algorithms/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Algorithms"},{"content":" A good competitor knows to memorize and follow all rules of the competition. A great competitor dedicates unfathomable amount of their energy to get ahead by finding loopholes in the rules.\nThe Premise #The FIRST Robotics Competition is, in my humble opinion the pinnacle of high school robotics competitions in the world. Every year a new rule set is released, and groups of fnatic high school robot lovers need to figure out how to build the best robot possible in say 6-8 weeks.\nNow you might be thinking, how complex can rules for a high school robotics competition be? Well, the 2024 FRC Game Manual is a plesant 153 pages long. Say 300-400 words per page at an average reading speed of 300 words per miniute, it will take around 2.5-3.5 hours to give it a once over.\nSo how did these energy drink fueled high schoolers skirt around them rules, and more importantly how are any of these related to computer algorithms? Let me explain.\nThe Problem To Solve #In FRC\u0026rsquo;s 2022 competiton Rapid React, toward the end of each match robots gain extra points if it can climb and be suspended from a series of rungs. Of course, the higher the rung, the more points it earns.\nThe rungs\u0026rsquo; distance from the ground are as follows:\n7ft 7 6ft 3 5 ft 4 ft The problem however, lies in the following requirements:\nA robot may not be more than 4ft 4inch tall in the standard profile, and can not extent more than 16 inches beyond the profile. \u0026ndash; 2022 FRC Competition Game Manual1\nThis means the highest rung a robot can legally reach from the ground is the second lowest, and the robot must proceed rung by rung to score the most amount of points. Let\u0026rsquo;s now take a look at a couple common solutions.\nThe Orthodox Approaches #Two Pairs #The simplest and most brute force answer is to use two pair of arms. Have one of them piviot such that the robot can climb up to a rung and reach for the next one.\nTeam 3940 CyberTooth This approach requires two separate sets of arms to climb each individual rung once. If it is an algorithm its run time will be 2*n, which is still O(n).\nBicycle Crank #This is an improvement of the approach above. Instead of having two pairs of arms playing catch up, using a bicycle crank like structure allow the robot to climb up the rungs with significantly greater effiency.\nTeam 188 Robotnauts By not having two sets of arms, this climbing mechanism only need to iterate over the rungs once instead of twice. Making it an optimized O(n).\nThe Great Competitors #What\u0026rsquo;s Not In The Rule Book #Some of the teams read the rulebook carefully, and found out there are no rules prohibiting the robot from contacting the rest of the structure while climbing the rungs.\nTeam 1690 Orbit Team 2481 Roboteers And they did just that! With an additional mechanism to push against the structure holding the rungs, these teams were able to skip the rungs in the middle and go straight to the top. Improving O(n) to O(log(n)).\nHow Would A Human Do It? #But if you thought that\u0026rsquo;s the craziest method to climb to the highest rung you would be dead wrong. See a typical human is not tall enough to reach the monkey bars at the park, but we can make it up anyways.\nHow did we do it? That\u0026rsquo;s right, we jumped.\nTeam 4907 Thunderstamps This is it, the fastest way to the top. This is O(1).\nThe above is excerpted from 2022 FRC Competition Game Manual, section 9, Robot Construction Rules\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":null,"permalink":"/ideas/frc_mech_designs/","section":"Ideas","summary":"\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA good competitor knows to memorize and follow all rules of the competition.\nA great competitor dedicates unfathomable amount of their energy to get ahead by finding loopholes in the rules.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e","title":"I Love Robotics, And I Blame A Bunch of Highschoolers"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/ideas/","section":"Ideas","summary":"","title":"Ideas"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/ideas/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Ideas"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/robotics/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Robotics"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/css/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Css"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/html/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Html"},{"content":"This article offers a sample of basic Markdown formatting that can be used in Congo, also it shows how some basic HTML elements are decorated.\nHeadings #The following HTML \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;—\u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; elements represent six levels of section headings. \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; is the highest section level while \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; is the lowest.\nH1 #H2 #H3 #H4 #H5 #H6 #Paragraph #Xerum, quo qui aut unt expliquam qui dolut labo.
